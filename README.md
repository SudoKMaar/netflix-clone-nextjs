# Netflix Clone - Next.js

## Overview

This project is a Netflix clone built using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Recoil, Material-UI, and Heroicons, with Firebase for authentication. The goal of this project is to recreate the user interface and functionality of the popular streaming platform Netflix. Users can browse through a list of movies and TV shows, view details about each title, watch trailers, and even sign up or log in using Firebase authentication.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to their accounts using their email and password. Firebase handles the authentication process.

- **Browse Movies and TV Shows**: Users can explore a curated list of movies and TV shows, including Netflix originals, top-rated titles, trending content, action movies, comedies, horror movies, romance movies, and documentaries.

- **Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie or TV show card displays more information about the title, including its release date, genre, original language, overview, and voting statistics.

- **Watch Trailers**: Users can watch trailers for movies and TV shows by clicking on the play button, which opens a modal with the trailer video.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience across devices.

- **Stripe Integration (Upcoming Feature)**: In future updates, we plan to integrate Stripe to enable users to subscribe and make payments for premium content or subscription plans.
